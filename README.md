## ðŸ“– Problem Defination
Bacteria are responsible for causing a wide variety of infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis. To identify the specific pathogen causing the infection, doctors often rely on traditional methods such as culturing the organism in a laboratory dish. However, this approach may take weeks or even months before results are known.

Novel DNA sequencing technologies have proliferated over the past two decades. Continuous improvements in "next generation sequencing" (NGS) and "third generation sequencing" (TGS) have increased the fidelity and rate of sequencing, but it still takes hours or days to obtain a complete sequence. Furthermore, there are some clinical applications in which very rapid identification of a particular gene or genetic species becomes necessary, whereas identification of all genes is not necessary.

## Why I am doing this project?
In patients with septic shock from bacterial infection, identification of antibiotic-resistance genes is essential because mortality increases with a delay of 7.6% per hour in administering the correct antibiotics. Unfortunately, it takes more than 24 hours for bacteria recovered from an infected patient's blood to grow, Identifying the kind of microbe responsible for a infection is critical because certain kinds of bacteria are sensitive to particular antibiotics. Once the species of bacteria is identified, doctors can prescribe the right medication to treat the infection.

## Proposed Solution
Bacterial antibiotic resistance is becoming a significant health threat, and rapid identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is essential to save lives and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance.

So we will train a supervised machine learning classification model to identify microbes from Generalized Segmentation Algorithm (GSA) Data

## ðŸ”Ž Objective
Identify the ten different micro-forms of life from Generalized Segmentation Algorithm (GSA) Data

## ðŸ’¾ Data Summary

* Solidity: It is the ratio of area of an object to the area of a convex hull of the object. Computed as Area/ConvexArea.
* Eccentricity: The eccentricity is the ratio of length of major to minor axis of an object.
* EquivDiameter: Diameter of a circle with the same area as the region.
* Extrema: Extrema points in the region. The format of the vector is [top-left top-right right-top right-bottom bottom-right bottom-left left-bottom left-top].
* Filled Area: Number of on pixels in FilledImage, returned as a scalar.
* Extent: Ratio of the pixel area of a region with respect to the bounding box area of an object.
* Orientation: The overall direction of the shape. The value ranges from -90 degrees to 90 degrees.
* Euler number: Number of objects in the region minus the number of holes in those objects.
* Bounding box: Position and size of the smallest box (rectangle) which bounds the object.
* Convex hull: Smallest convex shape/polygon that contains the object.
* Major axis: The major axis is the endpoints of the longest line that can be drawn through the object. Length (in pixels) of the major axis is the largest dimension of the object.
* Minor axis: The axis perpendicular to the major axis is called the minor axis. Length (in pixels) of the minor axis is the smallest line connecting a pair of points on the contour.
* Perimeter: Number of pixels around the border of the region.
* Centroid: Centre of mass of the region. It is a measure of objectâ€™s location in the image.
* Area: Total number of pixels in a region/shape.
* microorganisms : [Spirogyra, Volvox, Pithophora, Yeast, Raizopus, Penicillum, Aspergillus sp, Protozoa, Diatom, Ulothrix]
